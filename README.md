# IV1351 Data Storage Paradigms - Project: Soundgood Music School

<!-- This is a repository for a project in the course IV1351 Data Storage Paradigms fall term 2022. The repository should contain all tasks for the project
and will be updated during the course of the project. This repository is made as a direct way for the teachers of the course to reach the source code/project. -->

This is a project made during the course IV1351 Data Storage Paradigms, where a fully functioning and queryable database was created.  
The project consists of
 - task 1: creating a conceptual model.
 - task 2: converting the conceptual model into a logical model, and then the logical model into a SQL database creation script.
 - task 3: creating SQL scripts that can handle certain queries.

## Want to try and query our database?
 1. Have PostgreSQL installed.
 2. Download all of the .sql scripts from the `Task3` folder.
 3. Navigate to PostgreSQL's `scripts` folder. If the installation location was not changed, the folder can be found at `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\scripts` (Windows)
 4. Insert the .sql scripts into `scripts`.
 5. Open PostgreSQL's SQL Shell.
 6. Create the database with the `create_sgdb.sql` script.
 7. Activate detection for UTF8 encoding with `\encoding UTF8`.
 8. Insert all the data with the `insert_sgdb.sql` script.
 9. You can now test the database with the remaining .sql query scripts.

## About the project:
This project was made during the fall term of 2022.  
The models (task 1 & 2) were made in Astah while the database was created in PostgreSQL.  
This repository was mainly used as a way for the teachers of the course to grade the course project.

## This project was collaborative effort between:
